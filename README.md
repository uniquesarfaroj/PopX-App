# POPX-APP
 PopX-App is a simple, responsive web application built using React.js, designed to provide a user authentication flow with a clean and modern user interface. The app allows users to sign up, sign in, and view their account settings, with a focus on a seamless user experience across both mobile and desktop devices. It serves as a basic example of a front-end application with navigation, form handling, and state management, making it a good starting point for learning React development.
